Explica Prototype

<h2>About</h2>
This prototype application was designed to convert Explica.co's website into a mobile application. This app is written in Swift and features various simple animations and a convenient UI for easy navigation. Due to the lack of a useable API, the application is currently hard-coded, but would just need some simple editing to be compatible with an API to stay in sync with the website.
